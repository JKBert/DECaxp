/*
 * AXP_Branch_Prediction
 *
 *	This function is called to determine if a branch should be taken or not.
 *	It uses past history, locally and globally, to determine this.
 *
 *	The Local History Table is indexed by bits 2-11 of the VPC.  This entry
 *	contains a 10-bit value (0-1023), which is generated by indicating when
 *	a branch is taken(1) versus not taken(0).  This value is used as an index
 *	into a Local Predictor Table.  This table contains a 3-bit saturation
 *	counter, which is incremented when a branch is actually taken and
 *	decremented when a branch is not taken.
 *
 *	The Global History Path, which is generated by the set of taken(1)/not
 *	taken(0) branches.  This is used as an index into a Global Predictor Table,
 *	which contains a 2-bit saturation counter.
 *
 *	The Global History Path is also used as an index into the Choice Predictor
 *	Table.  This table contains a 2-bit saturation counter that is incremented
 *	when the Global Predictor is correct, and decremented when the Local
 *	Predictor is correct.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *	cpu:
 *		A pointer to the structure containing the information needed to emulate
 *		a single CPU.
 *	vpc:
 *		A 64-bit value of the Virtual Program Counter.
 *
 * Output Parameters:
 *	localTaken:
 *		A location to receive a value of true when the local predictor
 *		indicates that a branch should be taken.
 *	globalTaken:
 *		A location to receive a value of true when the global predictor
 *		indicates that a branch should be taken.
 *	choice:
 *		A location to receive a value of true when the global predictor should
 *		be selected, and false when the local predictor should be selected.
 *		This parameter is only used when the localPredictor and GlobalPredictor
 *		do not match.
 *
 * Return Value:
 *	true:	Prediction logic indicates to take the branch.
 *	false:	Prediction logic indicates to not take the branch.
